# Socks algorithm

Here is the question I have been asked during a coding interview.

Let's say you want to go on holidays. 

You have a drawer with clean socks. Each sock has a specific color.

You have a second drawer with dirty socks.

You only have time to do one washing machine with socks.

The washing machine can take only 'k' socks. 

How many socks, in an optimized way, can you put in your bag?
